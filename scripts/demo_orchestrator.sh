# Hackathon demo, steps 1 and 9: the orchestrator hands the claim to the agent
# through the ACP-A2A gateway; the agent records every step through the ksg MCP
# tools (scripts/ksg_mcp.py) — including every Muse Spark call and the SAM mask —
# exports the pages the expert will get, and writes the explanation for the
# judge. The program checks what that explanation points at.
#
#   scripts/demo_orchestrator.sh [agent_id] [case_file]
#
# agent_id defaults to hermes-cloud (Muse Spark through Meta Model API, owner 26.10);
# the agent must have the `ksg` MCP server (scripts/ksg_mcp.py) with MODEL_API_KEY,
# KSG_PANEL, KSG_VERIFY, KSG_WORK set, and the Meta Model API provider (Muse Spark).
#
# Owner's decision 27.10: the explanation for the judge is written by the agent
# itself (Hermes, Muse Spark) — it ends its answer with an `EXPLANATION:` block and
# this script checks that block's [p:N] links. So the orchestrator needs no Meta
# key of its own: the key load below only serves the old mode (judge_explain.py
# without --text, where the program asks the model itself).
#
# Environment of this script: MODEL_API_KEY (optional, old mode only; when it is
# empty the key is read from the file named by KSG_META_KEY_FILE — but only when
# that variable is set: there is no default key path, and the value is never
# printed), KSG_WORK (default: ./ksg-work), KSG_PANEL, KSG_VERIFY, KSG_CLASS.
#
# KSG_WORK must be the same directory the agent's `ksg` MCP server writes to
# (its own `env:` block in the gateway's Hermes config): the orchestrator reads
# the pages the agent exported from there in step 9.

New task. You are an insurance claims agent. Last step, and part of your reply:
1. Call ksg_get_container once (returns the existing container).
2. Finish the answer with a block that starts with the line `EXPLANATION:` —
   the decision explained to the hackathon judge in plain language, no jargon,
   at most 120 words. Every statement in it must carry a citation `[p:N]` to
   its own page, N being a page you wrote above. The program checks those
   links; a citation of a page that does not exist is a failed demo.
First line of your reply: `STEP 7 OK`. Then the `EXPLANATION:` block. Also
report: the container name and identifier, the decision, and for each exported
page its number, its file and whether it was ACCEPTED.
